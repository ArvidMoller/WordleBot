# Description: This program guesses a word to enter in Wordle.
# Required files: void
# Required gems: void


# Guesses a word based on data-state of previous letters and what row it is (words with duplicate letters aren't allowed in first row). All words are read from sortedWords.txt file.
#
# Paramiters:
# - correct: Array of correct letters.
# - present: Array of present letters.
# - absent: Array of absent letters.
# - enterdWords: Array of all entered words (I know I spelled it wrong).
# - currentRow: Integer showing which row is currently played.
#
# Returns: A word which meets all criteria to be guessed.
