# Description: This program adds words from addWords.txt (if they aren't already in words.txt) and then sorts all words in words.txt file based on how common their letters are.
# Requried files: words.txt, sortedWords.txt, addWords.txt
# Requried gems: void

# Sorts array of words based on their points using quickSort.
#
# Paramiters:
# - arr: The array that is going to be sorted. Stucture of array: [[word1, points2], [word2, points2], [word3, points3]].
#
# Returns: The array with all words sorted based on points.
